<<<<<<< Updated upstream
    "The plan is to combine first- and last-mile transport data with CBS data concerning the built environment of the train station surroundings. Cumbersome first- and last-mile transport can be an inhibition in choosing public transport. The goal is to obtain a better understanding of these factors in multi-modal trips. Data sources are NS, CBS and ODiN. The plan is to choose data from a specific year (probably 2019) and only within The Netherlands NS train stations."

    "The plan is to combine first- and last-mile transport data from NS with CBS data concerning the built environment of the train station surroundings. Cumbersome first- and last-mile transport can be an inhibition in choosing public transport. The goal is to obtain a better understanding of these factors in multi-modal trips. Data sources are NS, CBS, PDOK en Overheid.nl. The plan is to choose data from a specific year (probably 2019) and only within the NS stations form the provinces North- and South-Holland.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NS data provides insight into the pre- and post-transportation from the stations. Moreover, we combine the surface area and the number of inhabitants of the postal codes to calculate the population density. Subsequently, an assumption has been made about which postal codes use which stations. The average population density associated with a station and the pre- and post-transportation can provide insight into the choices regarding the types of modes of transport.\n"
